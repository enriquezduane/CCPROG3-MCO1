- Each slot is mapped to a specific unique item.
- Minimum requirements: 8 slots and a capacity of 10 items per slot.
- Items should have clear availability indicators.
- Allows users to make payments in different denominations.
- Dispenses items based on user's choice.
- Produces change when necessary.

### MCO1 Reminders
